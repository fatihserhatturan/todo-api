# Todo API with nodejs


Todo API Description

The Todo API is a web service created using Node.js and Express.js to manage tasks. This API allows users to create, update, delete, and view tasks. Users can categorize tasks, assign priority levels, and set due dates.

Features:

List Tasks: Users can view all tasks. Tasks can be sorted by categories, priority levels, and due dates.

Add New Task: Users can add new tasks. They can provide a name, description, category, priority level, and due date for the task.

Update Task: Users can update existing tasks. They can modify the status (completed/incomplete), name, description, category, priority level, and due date.

Delete Task: Users can delete a task. Deleted tasks are permanently removed from the database.

Priority Levels: Tasks can have priority levels assigned, such as "High," "Medium," and "Low."

Due Date: Each task can have a due date. Users can sort tasks based on due dates.

Categorization: Tasks can be categorized, allowing users to manage tasks more efficiently.

Usage Scenarios:

Users can add a new task using the API when they want to create a new task.
Users can use the API to view or update the details of an existing task.
Users can mark tasks as completed or delete them using the API.
